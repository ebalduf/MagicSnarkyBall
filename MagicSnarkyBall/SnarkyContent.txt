For $10.Well I'll be!Absolutely not.Man, the crap you come up with!Oh brother!Oh Dear. Dear. Dear.You're not the sharpest tool in the shed.Doubtful.You've got a screw loose.You're one card short of a deck.I just bought you a membership to the gym.  You're welcome.Oh dear. What are you thinking?You're short a couple of marbles.I'll get back to you on that.I'm going to need to sleep on that.Foolish, I say.Stop thinking so hard. I can see the smoke coming out your ears.Bah Humbug.Take off you hoser.What on Earth are you thinking?You're obviously not thinking.That would cramp my style.I can dig it.That's the greatest idea since peanut butter.That's the greatest idea since sliced bread.That's the greatest idea since sliced peanut butter.That's the greatest idea since peanut bread.That would be wicked awesome.Goodness gracious. Yes!!Don't ask me. That's not my bag.Groovy idea.Couldn't say.

No.I'll take a swag - No.Um, no.Okey Dokey, Smokey.Bless your little heart.  I don't think so, hun.A little bird told me yes.What kind of question is that?I'm busy now. Can I ignore you some other time?I don't know what makes you stupid but it really works!Did your parent's ever ask you to run away from home?Between you, me and the fencepost, the answer is no.I may be fat, but you're ugly and I can diet.Earth is full.  Go home.People like you are the reason I'm on medication.You know the drill.  Leave a message and I'll ignore it.I'd insult you but you're not bright enough to notice.Does your train of thought have a caboose?I'm trying to imagine you with a personality.No. Nobody says that.And which dwarf are you?Do I look like a people person?Whatever look you were going for, you missed.Nice perfume.  Must you marinate in it?I plead temporary insanity.Are you always dumb or is today a special occasion?Don't think.

I take that back; you are a weasel's rump.You are a big suck on a sour lemon.You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you.You are a technicolor yawn. And did I mention that you smell?You are a squeaking rat, a mistake of nature and a heavy-metal bagpipe player.You were not born. You were hatched into an unwilling world.You are a thick-headed trog. I have seen skeet with more sense than you have. You are a few bricks short of a full load.You are a few cards short of a full deck.You are a few bytes short of a full core dump. Worse than that, you top-post. You are the entropy which will claim us all.  You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting.You're a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot. You are not ANSI compliant and your markup doesn't validate. You have a couple of address lines shorted together. You should be promoted to Engineering Manager.You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are sour and senile. You are a cross-eyed drooling toesucker. You make Quakers shout and strike Pentecostals silent. You have a version 1.0 mind in a version 6.13 world. Your mother had to tie a pork chop around your neck just to get your dog to play with you. You believe that P.D.Q. Bach is the greatest composer who ever lived. Hee-Haw is too deep for you. You would watch test patterns all day if the other inmates would let you.You are deficient in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper.You are dank and filthy.You are asinine and benighted.Spammers look down on you.Telemarketers refuse to be seen in public with you.You are the source of all unpleasantness.You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.You are a Pusillanimous galactophage and you wear your sister's training bra.Don't bother opening the door when you leave - you should be able to slime your way out underneath.You smarmy lagerlout git.Knock on wood.I have no clue.What in tarnation?Holy cow.  Not you again.Bugger off, pillock. You are a foot-licking half-twit. Step away from the cookie jar.You are so clueless that if you dressed in a clue skin, doused yourself in clue musk, and did the clue dance in the middle of a field of horny clues at the height of clue mating season, you still would not have a clue.You are a fiend and a sniveling coward, and you have bad breath. You are the unholy spawn of a bandy-legged hobo and a syphilitic camel.You wear strangely mismatched clothing with oddly placed stains.You are degenerate, noxious and depraved.You are jetsam who dreams of becoming flotsam. You won't make it.You are Meta-stupid. Stupid cubed. Trans-stupid stupid. The only thing worse than your logic is your manners.Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success. P.S.: You are despicable, belligerent, and Generally Not Good.P.S.: You are crazy, weird, and Generally Not Good.P.S.: You are dim, dyspeptic, and Generally Not Good.
